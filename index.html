  <p>Hi my name is Mohamed Nour i am a 25 year old somali that is currently working as a TechOps role for a financial startup
    called Fnality the job involves a lot of admin work rather than TechOps stuff. I am planning to leave this job after 6 months-
    1 Year as i feel that i will be involved in the acceptance of Usury(<strong>Interest</strong>) which is unacceptable for me
    as a <strong>Muslim</strong>. However in order to leave my Job I must Level UP both spiritually and Financially I'm planning to
    do my AWS solutions architect exam as well as finish off all my Udemy courses within 6 months within this timeframe i hope
    <em><strong>Inshallah</strong></em> that will have some Projects Up My sleve to show to my new employer</p>
